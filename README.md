# TigerTag Development
### What is TigerTag?
TigerTag is a cloud based Laser Tag system built by RIT students for campus wide and mini-game style competitions. In comparison to traditional laser tag technologies, TigerTag aims to break the boundaries of "inside the box" gameplay, and replace it with competitions and games that are able to scale over large distances with multiple modes of game play.
